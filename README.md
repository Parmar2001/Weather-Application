# Weather-Application
I created an app based on HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to share your thoughts

The icons we will be using for our web application are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager. Link to her Repo: https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
